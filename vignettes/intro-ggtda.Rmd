## Purpose

The ggtda package provides users with a ggplot2-compatible tool to visualize persistent homology as part of a topological data analysis pipeline.
This vignette introduces how users can use ggtda to construct publication-quality topological barcodes [@barcode1;@barcode2], flat persistence diagrams [@flatpersist], and diagonal persistence diagrams [@diagpersist].

## Setup and dataset details

We first setup our environment as follows, attaching the necessary R packages (including ggtda itself!) and loading the required dataset.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library("ggtda")
library("TDAstats") # to calculate persistent homology

# load dataset
data("annulus2d")
```

The `annulus2d` dataset (visualized below) comes with ggtda, and will be used to demonstrate each form of visualization.

```{r annulus-scatter, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
annulus_df <- as.data.frame(annulus2d)
ggplot(annulus_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```

The `annulus2d` dataset contains 100 points noisily distributed around the circumference of a unit circle.
We will calculate its persistent homology using the TDAstats package (following code block) and then plot the result with each of the three visualizations using ggtda.

```{r phom}
# calculate persistent homology of annulus and format
annulus_phom <- as.data.frame(calculate_homology(annulus2d))
annulus_phom$dimension <- as.factor(annulus_phom$dimension)
```

We take a quick peek with `head()` and `tail()` to see what the raw form of `annulus2d`'s persistent homology looks like.

```{r peek}
# first few features (0-dimensional)
head(annulus_phom)

# last few features (1-dimensional)
tail(annulus_phom)
```

Clearly, graphical visualizations would permit easier and more effective interpretation than printing raw data.
We will start off by plotting this as a topological barcode.

*N.B.* although TDAstats calculates persistent homology using the Vietoris-Rips complex, persistent homology from another simplicial complex (e.g. ÄŒech complex) can also be visualized with ggtda.
To account for this, the axes will be labeled in a generic manner that should be adapted by users depending on the specific context.

## Topological barcode (aka persistence barcode)

Topological barcodes plot features as vertically stacked horizontal bars.
Here, each bar corresponds to a single feature (single row in `annulus_phom`) with the left boundary of the bar corresponding to the simplicial complex radius at which the feature appears (birth column in `annulus_phom`) and the right boundary of the bar corresponding to the simplicial complex radius at which the feature disappears (death column in `annulus_phom`).
Creating a topological barcode with ggtda is straightforward using `geom_barcode`.

```{r barcode, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
# create topological barcode with appropriate theme
ggplot(annulus_phom, aes(start = birth, end = death,
                         group = dimension, colour = dimension)) +
  geom_barcode() +
  xlab("Simplicial complex radius") +
  theme_barcode()
```

The `group` aesthetic orders features by dimension ensuring that all 0-dimensional features a plotted in one group, all 1-dimensional features above them, and so on.
The `color` aesthetic allows for explicit discrimination between features of different dimensions.

Given that an annulus (aka noisy circle) has a Betti-1 number equal to 1, the dominant 1-dimensional feature (or 1-cycle) is plotted just as expected.
This finding should be replicated in the persistence diagrams below.

## Persistence diagrams

Flat persistence diagrams plot features as points on a scatterplot.
Each point corresponds to a single feature (one row in `annulus_phom`), with the horizontal coordinate equal to the simplicial complex radius at which the feature appears (birth column in `annulus_phom`) and the vertical coordinate equal to the persistence of the feature (difference between death and birth columns in `annulus_phom`).
Flat persistence diagrams are generated using `stat_persistence` as follows.

```{r flatpersist, fig.height=3.5, fig.width = 4.5}
# create flat persistence diagram with appropriate theme
ggplot(annulus_phom, aes(start = birth, end = death,
                         shape = dimension, colour = dimension)) +
  stat_persistence() +
  xlab("Feature appearance") +
  ylab("Feature persistence") +
  theme_persist()
```

The `shape` and `colour` aesthetics redundantly discriminate between features of different dimensions.
This is particularly useful when one of the aesthetics (e.g. color) is rendered ineffective (e.g. due to color-blind readers).

Diagonal persistence diagrams can also be generated with `stat_persistence` by setting the `diagram` parameter to `"diagonal"`.
A reference line often helps interpretation of diagonal persistence diagrams so we add one with `geom_abline`.
Aesthetically, it is also generally pleasing to have the vertical and horizontal axes on a fixed coordinate system with both plotting the same range.

```{r diagadjust, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 4.5}
# create diagonal persistence diagrams with adjustments
ggplot(annulus_phom, aes(start = birth, end = death,
                         shape = dimension, colour = dimension)) +
  stat_persistence(diagram = "diagonal") +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
  xlim(c(0, 1.5)) +
  ylim(c(0, 1.5)) +
  xlab("Feature appearance") +
  ylab("Feature disappearance") +
  theme_persist()
```

`ggplot2::ggsave` can be used to save plots produced by ggtda.
Thus, running the following line of code will save the most recently plotted diagram (diagonal persistence diagram) as a PNG image file in the local working directory.

```{r save-eg, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("my-plot.png")
```
